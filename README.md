## Database

Instructions for local machine database development. The following assumes that you:

1. Are running on a linux based machine.
2. Installed postgresql and during this process, the default postgres user has been created.
3. The postgresql localhost server is running.
4. You have created a database called `irs`.

### Creation
After creating a new database called irs, run this command from terminal to generate schema:
```
sudo -u postgres psql irs < db/schema.sql
```
This structure will be loaded into the default `public` schema. Developers may also want to load some test records to their database. They can do so with the `test.sql` script:

```
sudo -u postgres psql irs < db/test.sql
```

### Nuking
To start from scratch, run:
```
echo "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;" | sudo -u postgres psql irs
```


## Code Quality

### Pre-commit Checks
Before doing your commits, git add your changed files and run `pre-commit` to do some syntax and code quality
checks. When it can, pre-commit will correct those files for you.

To use, simply run:
```
git add . || git add [specific files]
pre-commit
git add [files which pre-commit fixed up]
git commit -m "happy days"
git push
```

*Note: You will need to re-add any files that pre-commit fixes up for you. If there weren't any and it 
passed everything then you may commit what your original staged files*
